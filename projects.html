            <p>Migrated a  production environment SQL Server database containing 5 tables to Azure SQL Database. Generated full backup of the production database & restored the database in a new development environment to allow safe testing & experimentation. Automated database backups in development environment using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Built a discovery recovery solution for the Azure SQL Database, increasing database availability from an initial 99.5% to >99.99%. Integrated Microsoft Entra ID authentication with Azure SQL Database to create two identity management groups: administrators and read-only clients.</p>

            <b style="font-size:150%;">AiCore: Dec 2023 - Jan 2024</b>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/Jude-Everitt/multinational-retail-data-centralisation377.git" target="_blank"><b>Click here to view GitHub repo</b></a></p>
            <p>Developed a system that extracts sales data from 5 data sources: PDF documents, AWS RDS database, RESTful API, JSON & CSV files. Constructed custom Python scripts to clean and transform over 120k rows of data, before loading the data into a PostgreSQL database. Designed a star-schema database by joining 5 dimensions tables, resulting in data querying time with < 1 millisecond latency. Wrote >10 complex SQL queries to extract business insights from the data, including velocity of sales, yearly revenue and regions with the most sales.</p>

            <b style="font-size:150%;"> UoY Masters Dissertation: Sep 2021 - Jul 2022</b>
            <p>The s467 campaign at GSI working in collaboration with R3B proposes that short- and long-range correlations in nucleon-nucleon interactions are the reasoning behind quenching of spectroscopic factors in (p,2p) transfer reactions. The evolution of single-particle strengths in Calcium’s neutron rich isotropic chain is investigated by measuring the cross-section of kinematically complete proton removal reactions performed in inverse kinematics. The approach of the experiment is to calculate the cross-sections by measuring the average energy loss of swift exotic particles as they travel through a Multi-Sampling-Ionisation-Chamber (MUSIC) detector. The project shows that the multiple dependencies of the Bethe-Bloch formula can simultaneously be applied to the detected average energy loss of exotic particles to calibrate and enhance the performance of MUSIC. Taking advantage of MUSICs capabilities for taking multiple measurements over a wide energy range. I created custom C++ scripts to gain match and apply statistical analysis techniques on data trees containing energy loss data on >10,000 of particle collisions for detector calibration. It was found that the detection resolution for Z=20 particles can be increased by 7%. The increased resolution brought on a means of accurately identifying particles in a Cartesian methodology using the sigma separation.</p>
