    <div class="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Background: Graduated from the University of York in 2023 with a Masters in Physics in Physics with Astrophysics, writing a dissertation contributing to a nuclear astrophysics research projects which entailed reviewing the process i carried out calibrating and in improving the performance of a Multi-Sampling Ionisation Chamber particle detector. Then I worked as a Youth Support Worker with Carefocus Ltd, where I mentored at risk youth with a diverse backgrounds. Providing emotional and practical support for safeguarding and helping to develop essential life skills. Next, I travelled South America for some new personal experiences as well as doing some volunteering in Brazil. Now I have decided to migrate towards a more tech-focused career where I am now in the process of completing a Cloud Engineering skills bootcamp with AiCore. I have recently finished projects on software engineering data centralisation and cloud data migration and recovery. within the bootcamp and looking to start my career.</p> 
        <p>Technical Skills:
            <ul>
                <li>Scripting: Python, ROOT (Written in C++)</li>
                <li>Databases: PostgreSQL, SQLTools</li>
                <li>Cloud: Azure (VM's, SQL Server), AWS</li>
            </ul>
        </p>    
        <p>Soft Skills: Currently taking the initiative to study Cloud Engineering with AiCore where I am independently learning the course content and carrying out various projects. Beforehand working as a youth support worker, I worked in a team to create and implement engaging and interactive therapeutic workshops on various topics and personal support plans, and then conducted regular assessments and evaluations on progress. I had to perform well under pressure when carrying out crisis intervention tactics with any safeguarding issues. Only a few months after starting I began to shift lead and mentor new staff with their training.</p>  
        </p>Professional Growth: Ive recently completed a certification in Software Engineering by completing a project on data centralisation. I am currently in the process of completing a certification in Cloud Engineering by completing a project on data migration and recovery within Azure and SQL. As a personal project I am also in the process of hard coding and designing my own website with HTML.</p>    
        </p>Current Goals: To finish AiCore skills bootcamp and start my career! Also, to carry on worrking on my own website (which you are currently viewing!) and to read Tolkien's The Silmarillion.</p>

            <p><b>GitHub Repo URL:</b> https://github.com/Jude-Everitt/Azure-Database-Migration.git</p>
            <p>Migrated a  production environment SQL Server database containing 5 tables to Azure SQL Database. Generated full backup of the production database & restored the database in a new development environment to allow safe testing & experimentation. Automated database backups in development environment using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Built a discovery recovery solution for the Azure SQL Database, increasing database availability from an initial 99.5% to >99.99%. Integrated Microsoft Entra ID authentication with Azure SQL Database to create two identity management groups: administrators and read-only clients.</p>

            <p>Developed a system that extracts sales data from 5 data sources: PDF documents, AWS RDS database, RESTful API, JSON & CSV files. Constructed custom Python scripts to clean and transform over 120k rows of data, before loading the data into a PostgreSQL database. Designed a star-schema database by joining 5 dimensions tables, resulting in data querying time with < 1 millisecond latency. Wrote >10 complex SQL queries to extract business insights from the data, including velocity of sales, yearly revenue and regions with the most sales.</p>

            <b style="font-size:150%;"> UoY Masters Dissertation: Sep 2021 - Jul 2022</b>
            <p>The s467 campaign at GSI working in collaboration with R3B proposes that short- and long-range correlations in nucleon-nucleon interactions are the reasoning behind quenching of spectroscopic factors in (p,2p) transfer reactions. The evolution of single-particle strengths in Calciumâ€™s neutron rich isotropic chain is investigated by measuring the cross-section of kinematically complete proton removal reactions performed in inverse kinematics. The approach of the experiment is to calculate the cross-sections by measuring the average energy loss of swift exotic particles as they travel through a Multi-Sampling-Ionisation-Chamber (MUSIC) detector. The project shows that the multiple dependencies of the Bethe-Bloch formula can simultaneously be applied to the detected average energy loss of exotic particles to calibrate and enhance the performance of MUSIC. Taking advantage of MUSICs capabilities for taking multiple measurements over a wide energy range. I created custom C++ scripts to gain match and apply statistical analysis techniques on data trees containing energy loss data on >10,000 of particle collisions for detector calibration. It was found that the detection resolution for Z=20 particles can be increased by 7%. The increased resolution brought on a means of accurately identifying particles in a Cartesian methodology using the sigma separation.</p>
