        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Background:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    <p>I graduated from the University of York in 2023 with a Masters in Physics with Astrophysics (MPhys).</p>
                    <p>My time studying physics helped to develop strong problem solving skills which were refined by starting with incremental specific problems and seminars addressing direct module content, which then funnelled into multi-dimensional problems in practical labs. Within these labs, I conducted different practical experiments to investigate problems and scientific laws, keeping a full chronological and contemporaneous record of scientific approach, results and analysis. Transitioning into a high volume of assignments more akin to the real world on challenging problems that can't solely be solved from rote learning under short-timed pressure.</p>
                    <p>All leading up into a final year advanced independent research project answering previously unaddressed questions. I worked in assisting the s467 campaign at GSI working in collaboration with R3B. My role was to calibrate, analyse and optimise the performance of a new type of particle detector. Achieved by writing custom C++ scripts to analyse reaction data simultaneously with specific equations to identify particles in a cartesian methodology.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I then worked as a Youth Support Worker with Carefocus Ltd, where I mentored at risk youth from diverse backgrounds. Providing emotional and practical support for safeguarding and helping to develop essential life skills.</p>
                    <p>I worked in a team to create and implement engaging and interactive therapeutic workshops on various topics and personal support plans, and then conducted regular assessments and evaluations on progress. I had to perform well under pressure when carrying out crisis intervention tactics with any safeguarding issues. A few months after starting I began to shift lead and mentor new staff with their training. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I then took a 6 month career break to fulfil my aspirations to travel. I spent 4 months travelling with two friends from Colombia, through Peru, Bolivia, Argentina to Brazil. I then spent 2 months travelling through Brazil solo and spent sometime volunteering in the Atlantic Rainforest. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Now I have decided to migrate towards a more tech-focused career, where I am now in the process of completing a Cloud Engineering skills bootcamp with AiCore. I have recently finished projects on software engineering data centralisation and cloud data migration and recovery. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Technical Skills:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scripting: Python, ROOT (Written in C++)</li>
                <li>Databases: PostgreSQL, SQLTools</li>
                <li>Cloud: Azure (VM's, SQL Server), AWS</li>
            </ul>   
        <h3>Professional Growth:</h3> 
        <p>I've recently completed a certification in Software Engineering by completing a project on data centralisation. I am currently in the process of completing a certification in Cloud Engineering by completing a project on data migration and recovery within Azure and SQL. As a personal project I am also in the process of hard coding and designing my own website with HTML, CS and JS.</p>    
        <h3>Current Goals:</h3>
        <p>To finish AiCore skills bootcamp and start my career! Also, to carry on worrking on my own website (which you are currently viewing!) and to read Tolkien's The Silmarillion.</p>
