        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Background:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    <p>I graduated from the University of York in 2023 with a Masters in Physics with Astrophysics (MPhys).</p>
                    <p>Through the program’s practical labs and coursework, I developed strong problem solving, record keeping, and project management skills. In the final year, I conducted an advanced independent research project, assisting the s467 campaign at GSI in collaboration with R3B. My role was to calibrate, analyse, and optimise the performance of a new type of particle detector. This was achieved by writing custom C++ scripts to analyse reaction data simultaneously with specific equations to identify particles in a cartesian methodology.</p>
                    
                <li>
                    <p>I then went on to work as a Youth Support Worker with Carefocus Ltd, where I mentored at risk and traumatised youth from diverse backgrounds.</p>
                    <p>In this capacity, I provided emotional and practical support for safeguarding, planned individualized therapeutic workshops and support plans, and conducted regular assessments and evaluations on progress. I was later promoted to shift lead, mentoring staff with their training.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Last year I took a career break to fulfil my aspirations to travel, spending 6 months in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Now I have decided to migrate towards a more tech-focused career, where I have just finished completing a Cloud Engineering skills bootcamp with AiCore. Completing projects on software engineering data centralisation and cloud data migration and recovery.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Technical Skills:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scripting: Python, ROOT (Written in C++), HTML.</li>
                <li>Databases: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin 4, SQLTools, Azure Data Studio, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.</li>
                <li>Cloud: AWS, Azure (VM's, SQL Server, SQL Database, Entra ID, Migration Service, Storage Accounts).</li>
            </ul>   
        <h3>Professional Growth:</h3> 
        <p>I have recently completed a Cloud Engineering skills bootcamp with AiCore. Completing certifications in Cloud Engineering and Software Engineering.</p>    
        <h3>Current Goals:</h3>
        <p>To start my career in data and tech and apply for jobs.</p>
        <p>I have just started  my first Kaggle Competition in “House Prices Prediction using TFDF”, looking to apply my Python knowledge and expand my knowledge on Machine Learning.</p>
        <p>As a personal project I am continuously updating and designing my own website with HTML, CS and JS (Which you are now viewing!). Adding information, current personal milestones and improving functionality.</p>
