        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Background: Graduated from the University of York in 2023 with a Masters in Physics in Physics with Astrophysics, writing a dissertation contributing to a nuclear astrophysics research projects which entailed reviewing the process i carried out calibrating and in improving the performance of a Multi-Sampling Ionisation Chamber particle detector. Then I worked as a Youth Support Worker with Carefocus Ltd, where I mentored at risk youth with a diverse backgrounds. Providing emotional and practical support for safeguarding and helping to develop essential life skills. Next, I travelled South America for some new personal experiences as well as doing some volunteering in Brazil. Now I have decided to migrate towards a more tech-focused career where I am now in the process of completing a Cloud Engineering skills bootcamp with AiCore. I have recently finished projects on software engineering data centralisation and cloud data migration and recovery. within the bootcamp and looking to start my career.</p> 
        <p>Technical Skills:
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </p>    
        <p>Soft Skills: Currently taking the initiative to study Cloud Engineering with AiCore where I am independently learning the course content and carrying out various projects. Beforehand working as a youth support worker, I worked in a team to create and implement engaging and interactive therapeutic workshops on various topics and personal support plans, and then conducted regular assessments and evaluations on progress. I had to perform well under pressure when carrying out crisis intervention tactics with any safeguarding issues. Only a few months after starting I began to shift lead and mentor new staff with their training.</p>  
        </p>Professional Growth: Ive recently completed a certification in Software Engineering by completing a project on data centralisation. I am currently in the process of completing a certification in Cloud Engineering by completing a project on data migration and recovery within Azure and SQL. As a personal project I am also in the process of hard coding and designing my own website with HTML.</p>
